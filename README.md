Description: ShoeTally is an inventory management shoe type application designed for shoe distributors who resell with retail stores. This not only aids users in tracking and managing shoe inventory with ease by making provision for adding products but also to place orders, manage customer orders and construct an extensive database on customers. Moreover, you can have a comprehensive list of transactions for registering old ordered orders & financial records. Not only does it feature powerful editing capabilities, but also when information is entered into the system (products or orders and customers), then simply adding/modifying that anytime will update all related fields to keep everything up-to-date.

General Objective: To efficiently manage stock levels to meet the demands of the clients while minimizing costs associated with overstocking or stockouts. It aims to track inventory in real time, ensuring the right shoes are available at the right time, optimizing both supply chain operations and sales performance.

#Specific Objective: 

To streamline the process of adding, updating, and managing shoe inventory by allowing middleman distributors to maintain real-time control over stock levels
To facilitate order management by enabling the tracking, processing, and fulfillment of customer orders from retail stores.
To provide accurate and detailed customer records by building a robust customer database with order histories and contact information for better relationship management.
To offer a comprehensive transaction history that records all previous orders and financial transactions, allowing for detailed audits and performance reviews.
To allow seamless modification of product, order, and customer information across the system, ensuring that updates in one area reflect throughout all related fields.
To minimize inventory management error and reduce operational costs related to stock discrepancies, overstocking, and stockouts.


#Scope: 
ShoeTally is a robust cross-platform shoe inventory management system. Developed in Flutter and powered by Firebase, its primary objective is to enhance the middleman distributor's operations with a focus on getting the retail store up and running. Some of its features are:
Product Management: Ability to add, edit, and manage shoe products with respective attributes such as quantity, sizes, and descriptions.
Order Processing: The system enables the ability to send orders directly to the retail customers and trace the order for fulfillment.
Customer Database: An all-inclusive list of customers that would contain contact information and order histories.
Transaction History: access the minute logs that involve detailed records of history about previous orders and other transactions that can be audited or reviewed.
Data Editing: make changes into necessary information concerning the product, customer, or orders to rectify it.
Utilizing Firebase, the system ensures real time data synchronization, secure storage, and scalability. Flutter allows the same codebase to run across multiple versions of Android and iOS. Thus, this will offer an efficient user experience regardless of the device.
#Limitations:
Industry-Specific Design: The system is specifically designed for shoe distribution businesses. Thus, the features created might need to be customized with regard to its usage in other industries.
Manual Inventory Updates: As powerful as the abilities of Firebase are in relation to live data, the app takes advantage of stock updates that must be manually entered into the system rather than automatically prompted from external systems.
Not Directly Customer Facing: The app is designed to use internally by distributors and does not include a retail customer-facing interface to view orders or even self-service.
Limited Integration with Third-Party Systems: ShoeTally does not natively integrate into third-party accounting or enterprise resource planning systems, therefore financial reporting and inventory management needs to be managed on a separate function.
Single User Authentication: Although Firebase does support user authentication, the current version of ShoeTally may not have multi-user role management but instead limits wide cooperation without further configuration.
